# CSC834
The repo for the work I have done as part of the CSC 834 Software Engineering Course at EKU

# Individual Project
The individual project should be a culmination of work from several of the first few weeks assignments.
It will be updated as the course progresses even after the week that introduces the used topic has concluded.

# Team Project
For the team project, I am partnered with one other master student. I will provide credit to each of their contributions,
and will provide their name/social media with their consent.
